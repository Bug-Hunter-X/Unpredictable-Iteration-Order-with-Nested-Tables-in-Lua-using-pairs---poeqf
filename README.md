This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Lua's `pairs()` iterator when dealing with nested tables.  The `pairs()` function does not guarantee a specific iteration order, which can lead to unexpected behavior in code that relies on a consistent order. This example shows a recursive function processing a nested table, illustrating how unpredictable iteration order can affect the outcome.  The solution demonstrates a method to iterate through nested tables in a defined order, if required.
